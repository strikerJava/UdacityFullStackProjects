## How do I use this?
To use this python code, you need to bring this into the vagrant machine setup in the course.
* Download the vagrant file, then use `vagrant up` to start it 
* Use `vagrant ssh` to log into the machine
* Call `python database_setup.py` to create the database object
* Run `python main.py` to connect to start the server. 
* Connect to localhost:8080 to use the main home page for the item manager.
